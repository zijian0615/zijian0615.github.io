<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
    I am a teaching assistant at the HKBU in the Department of AEF, where I work in assisting the <a href="https://mscdabe.hkbu.edu.hk/eng/main/Index">DABE</a> master program. I am currently seeking a PhD position in information science/computer science. In my research, I use computational methods to study online trust, data breaches, and platform security. I am also interested in sociolinguistic ideas, in other words, how to facilitate our expression and animate online communities.
</p>

<p>
    I earned my MS degree in Information Systems from <a href="https://www.cb.cityu.edu.hk/is/">City University of Hong Kong</a> in October 2023. I have a bachelor's degree in Economics from Nanjing Agricultural University and have worked as a research intern at places like Core Biotech. I have been recognized as an "Outstanding Graduate" at Nanjing Agri Univ.
</p>

<p>
    My past work has examined how people in crowdfunding communities form their online trust, how to mitigate data breaches in healthcare systems, and the interpretable multimodality reasoning algorithm.
